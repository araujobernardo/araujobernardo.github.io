            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>This year I decided that I want to learn how to code. I bought a CodeCademy membership and started the Full Stack Engineer Carrer Path. This page is one of many portifolio projects you do during the course. Since I had to create a landing page for myself, why not go ahead and display all the stuff I made through out the years. So here it is, feel free to wander around this website and if you find something you like, go to the contact page and send me a message. I would love to hear your toughts about all of this. Thanks for being here.
